# numpad-as-media-buttons
Small script which is intended to be run as Windows Task. 
It sets up global hotkeys: <numpad 5> as "media play/pause button", <numpad 7> as "media previous track", <numpad 9> as "next track"
Motivation: spotify are not going to implement global hotkeys and I don't like installing third-party software just for this pretty basic functionality. 
Was this feature in winamp in 2005? Yes
